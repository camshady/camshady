- 👋 Hi, I’m @camshady
- 👀 I’m interested in mechatronics. Thats robots and anything with a computer in it. 3 years into a 4 year engineering degree. 
      I'm not just an engineer, though. I also play drums and have been a part of several bands (but you haven't heard of me...yet).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about signals processing, ethics, and lots and lots of maths. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I believe is important. 
- 📫 How to reach me:
      If you're here then you already know how to reach me.
